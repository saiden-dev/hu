Hey folks, I have a dentist appointment 2h before standup, but it's a long commute with rush hour traffic, so I might miss the meeting.

The first of the three remaining bugs for flexible tickets (the one brought up yesterday) was approved by Guijia and is on its way to dev.

I have good progress on analyzing the remaining two and will do my best to have both ready for review today.
